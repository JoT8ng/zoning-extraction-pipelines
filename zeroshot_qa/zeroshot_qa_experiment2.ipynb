    "# Zero shot QA experiment 2 - DistilBERT vs RoBERTa\n",
    "## January 2026 (An update to the October 2025 experiment)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Zoning By-laws contain important information about land use, building height, density, and other development regulations. They are important documents that inform urban planning and development decisions in cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are often stored as long, unstructured PDF legal documents and it's difficult to find information within them. Zoning information is also spatial and tied to geospatial datasets. It would be great if the zoning information in the by-laws could be extracted in an efficient and automated way and joined with geospatial datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This experiement aims to test out and evaluate the performance of the DistilBERT and RoBERTa question answering models to extract information from zoning by-laws. This experiment is an update aiming to improve upon the October 2025 experiment.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Changes from the October 2025 experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "Some improvements have been made based on the lessons learned from the previous experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A dataset of 50 labeled examples was created to use in this experiment. The dataset was created manually from a range of different zoning by-laws from different municipalities across Canada.\n",
    "\n",
    "* LegalBERT did not perform well in the previous experiment. Therefore, in this updated experiment it was removed and it was decided to compare the accuracy between DistilBERT and RoBERTa.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why DistilBERT and RoBERTa?\n",
    "DistilBERT is a distilled or lighter version of the BERT model that was developed by Google. Because it is 40% smaller it makes it 60% faster at NLP tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, and question answering. Although, it is smaller it still retains 97% of BERT's accuracy. In the [Claude LLM API Pipeline](https://github.com/JoT8ng/zoning-extraction-pipelines/blob/main/llm_api_pipeline/src/README.md), Anthropic's Claude model was tested to extract information from zoning by-laws. One of the key limitations of using a model like Claude is that the generative component of the model is prone to hallucinations. **Unlike models like Claude and GPT, BERT is an encoder only model. This means it is good for tasks that require understanding of input like sentence classification or NER (named entity recognition).** For a task like extracting information from a zoning by-law, text generation is not that important. **LLMs like GPT and Claude who excel and are mainly used for generative tasks are not considered the most efficient at text classification and NER compared to bidirectional encoders like BERT. That is why a lighter version of BERT, DistilBERT, is chosen for this experiment.**\n",
    "\n",
    "[RoBERTa](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/roberta) is an optimized versiton of BERT and improves it with new pretraining objectives.  The pretraining objectives include dynamic masking, sentence packing, larger batches and a byte-level BPE tokenizer. Since it is a newer improved model it is generally considered to outperform BERT on NLP tasks. In this experiment a fine-tuned version on SQuAD 2 used for question answering called [roberta-base-squad2 or roberta-base for Extractive QA](https://huggingface.co/deepset/roberta-base-squad2) is used.\n",

    "In the previous experiment, a small dataset was used and it was concluded that a larger one might yield more meaninful results. As a first experiment, it was a good starting point but for a more rigorous test a larger dataset was desirable. A dataset of 50 labeled examples was created to use in this experiment. The dataset was created manually from a range of different zoning by-laws from different municipalities across Canada in an Excel document and exported into CSV format.\n",
    "\n",
    "To really test the efficacy of the models in extracting the zoning information, a range of different questions and contexts from different zoning by-laws throughout Canada are used. Some of the contexts are a mix of messy and clean snippets from the zoning by-law. One context contains a longer and messy snippet of raw text directly extracted from the pdf and another contains a similar long and messy snippet in raw markdown syntax. Snippets of tables in markdown syntax are also included.\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous October 2025 experiment highlighted that the model did not perform well when given messy contexts from the zoning by-law. With this larger zero shot evaluation dataset, hopefully a clearer understanding of the models performance can be achieved. The previous experiment also showed that the model is unable to handle cases where the correct answer is absent from the provided context, requiring separate error handling to be added in the script. Since the goal of this experiment aims to test the performance and accuracy of the DistilBERT model itself, rather than its ability to detect missing answers, any contexts without the answer have been removed from the evaluation dataset. This ensures that all test cases focus solely on the model's answer extraction capabilities.\n",

    "\n",
    "At first glance, it is understanble why the exact match (EM) scores for both models are only around 50%. The EM metric is very strict and even a small difference in wording or puncutation counts as incorrect. For example if the ground truth is \"on a corner lot\" but the model provides the response \"a corner lot\", the EM metric will count the response as incorrect. The F1 score is more forgiving and better reflects partial correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the F1 score, a score of 70% or higher is considered \"good\" in the industry. However, in this scenario where accuracy is extremely important because it involves legal answers, a score of 90-95% or higher is desirable.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not surprising that RoBERTa outperforms DistilBERT on both metrics because it is larger and is fine-tuned on the SQuAD2 dataset. DistilBERT is a compressed faster model and trades speed for accuracy. However, it would not be surprising if RoBERTa outperforms BERT as well because it is an optimized version of BERT due to improved pre-training methodology.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that there is a significant gap between the EM and F1 scores indicates that often produce partially correct answers that don't exactly match the ground truth/golden answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This experiment could consider using a more forgiving evaluation metric that looks at semantic similarity and partial matches, but it made sense to use an industry standard metric at the start.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also important to consider that the QA models were trained on a variety of other datasets, like SQuAD, and my zero shot dataset may be harder to interpret since they involve legal language and are very domain specific. When evaluated on SQuAD, top models normally achieve scores of EM > 85 and F1 > 90. When evaluated using zero shot on out of domain datasets, scores tend to drop significantly. Therefore, it might be a good idea to consider fine-tuning RoBERTa on text extracted from zoning by-laws.\n",

    "* Consider fine-tuning RoBERTa on text extracted from zoning by-laws.\n",
    "* Consider doing a cross-model evaluation exercise on other types of model architectures like Longformer and generative LLMs that are designed for processing long documents. RoBERTa has a maximum token size of 512 tokens, which is not that great when working with long legal documents like zoning by-laws. Since a pipeline has been developed to extract answers from zoning text snippets in the [Claude LLM API Pipeline Project](https://github.com/JoT8ng/zoning-extraction-pipelines/blob/main/llm_api_pipeline/src/README.md), consider evaluating the model's accuracy to compare with others.\n",
    "* Compared to fine-tuning a DistilBERT model, consider exploring alternative methods like OCR (optical character recognition). Using an OCR model may be more efficient although the results would have to be double checked and post-processing of the data is required."
