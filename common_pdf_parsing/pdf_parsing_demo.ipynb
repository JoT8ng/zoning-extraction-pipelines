    "# Zoning PDF Text Extraction and Parsing Functions Demo\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "Zoning By-laws contain important information about land use, building height, density, and other development regulations. They are important documents that inform urban planning and development decisions in cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are often stored as long, unstructured PDF legal documents and it's difficult to find information within them. Zoning information is also spatial and tied to geospatial datasets. It would be great if the zoning information in the by-laws could be extracted in an efficient and automated way and joined with geospatial datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "These functions extract text from the zoning by-law and parses it so that it can be used in other pipelines. Can also be used on its own to split up zoning by-law texts to make them easier to read and search for information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extract Markdown Function Demo\n",
    "The code opens a zoning by-law pdf document and uses the pymupdf4llm library to extract the text into markdown syntax. Markdown syntax is used because LLMs are better able to understand text and documents in markdown. Markdown provides heiarchy to text documents, which helps LLMs understand the pdf document structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "First let's import the required libraries, modules, and the requried parsing functions from parsing.py."

    "**How it works**\n",
    "This function uses two different regex patterns to extract zoning titles. When converting zoning by-law PDFs into markdown, the titles are either in \"**bold**\" or in \"####header\" format. The extracted markdown text is split into lines and a for loop goes through each line and tries to match it to either regex patterns. If a match exists, it looks for words \"zone\", \"district\", or \"division\" in the title to ensure it is a zoning category. Some titles include those words but are actually a sentence and not a zoning category. So the function also checks if the title is less than 150 characters. If it matches all those requirements, it's saved into the titles list.\n",
    "\n",
    "As zoning by-law texts vary so much there will always be some titles that are not categories extracted. To increase the accuracy, the [Claude LLM API Pipeline](https://github.com/JoT8ng/zoning-extraction-pipelines/blob/main/llm_api_pipeline/src/README.md) uses fuzzy matching to match the extracted categories with the category names in the geoJSON zoning file."
