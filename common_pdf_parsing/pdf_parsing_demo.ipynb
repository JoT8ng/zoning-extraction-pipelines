    "# Zoning PDF Text Extraction and Parsing Functions Demo\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "Zoning By-laws contain important information about land use, building height, density, and other development regulations. They are important documents that inform urban planning and development decisions in cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are often stored as long, unstructured PDF legal documents and it's difficult to find information within them. Zoning information is also spatial and tied to geospatial datasets. It would be great if the zoning information in the by-laws could be extracted in an efficient and automated way and joined with geospatial datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "These functions extract text from the zoning by-law and parses it so that it can be used in other pipelines. Can also be used on its own to split up zoning by-law texts to make them easier to read and search for information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extract Markdown Function Demo\n",
    "The code opens a zoning by-law pdf document and uses the pymupdf4llm library to extract the text into markdown syntax. Markdown syntax is used because LLMs are better able to understand text and documents in markdown. Markdown provides heiarchy to text documents, which helps LLMs understand the pdf document structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "First let's import the required libraries, modules, and the requried parsing functions from parsing.py."
