    "\n",
    "Zoning By-laws contain important information about land use, building height, density, and other development regulations. They are important documents that inform urban planning and development decisions in cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are often stored as long, unstructured PDF legal documents and it's difficult to find information within them. Zoning information is also spatial and tied to geospatial datasets. It would be great if the zoning information in the by-laws could be extracted in an efficient and automated way and joined with geospatial datasets.\n",
