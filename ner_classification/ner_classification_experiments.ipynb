    "# Zero shot classification experiments - testing and comparing DistilBERT and LEGAL-BERT\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Zoning By-laws contain important information about land use, building height, density, and other development regulations. They are important documents that inform urban planning and development decisions in cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are often stored as long, unstructured PDF legal documents and it's difficult to find information within them. Zoning information is also spatial and tied to geospatial datasets. It would be great if the zoning information in the by-laws could be extracted in an efficient and automated way and joined with geospatial datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This experiement aims to test out and evaluate the performance of DistilBERT and LEGAL-BERT question answering models to extract information from zoning by-laws.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why DistilBERT and LegalBERT\n",
    "DistilBERT is a distilled or lighter version of the BERT model that was developed by Google. Because it is 40% smaller it makes it 60% faster at NLP tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, and question answering. Although, it is smaller it still retains 97% of BERT's accuracy. In the [Claude LLM API Pipeline](https://github.com/JoT8ng/zoning-extraction-pipelines/blob/main/llm_api_pipeline/src/README.md), Anthropic's Claude model was tested to extract information from zoning by-laws. One of the key limitations of using a model like Claude is that the generative component of the model is prone to hallucinations. **Unlike models like Claude and GPT, BERT is an encoder only model. This means it is good for tasks that require understanding of input like sentence classification or NER (named entity recognition).** For a task like extracting information from a zoning by-law, text generation is not that important. **LLMs like GPT and Claude who excel and are mainly used for generative tasks are not considered the most efficient at text classification and NER compared to bidirectional encoders like BERT. That is why a lighter version of BERT, DistilBERT, is chosen for this experiment.**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many pre-trained models of BERT in the Hugging Face Transformer's library. [LEGAL-BERT](https://huggingface.co/nlpaueb/legal-bert-base-uncased) is a family of BERT models for the legal domain, intended to assist legal NLP research, computational law, and legal technology applications. LEGAL-BERT is pre-trained on 12 GB of diverse English legal text from several fields (e.g., legislation, court cases, contracts) scraped from publicly available resources. For more info on the data the model is pretrained on, refer to the model card on Hugging Face. **Since zoning by-law texts are legal documents, it would be interesting to compare the accuracy of DistilBERT vs LEGAL-BERT in this context**.\n",

    "### Creating the evaluation dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The functions in [Zoning PDF Text Extraction and Parsing Functions](https://github.com/JoT8ng/zoning-extraction-pipelines/tree/main/common_pdf_parsing) are used to extract text from a zoning by-law section. In the example below, the text from Burnaby's zoning by-law on R1 small scale multi unit housing is extracted. Unlike the Claude model, DistilBERT and LEGAL-BERT accept a smaller and more limited amount of tokens. Furthermore, the dataset had to be in a specific format containing the \"context\", \"question\", and \"ground truth\" for evaluating the model. Therefore, the chunks of text to be input as the \"context\" into the model had to be manually extracted.\n",
    "\n",
    "To really test the efficacy of the models in extracting the zoning information, a range of different questions and contexts are used. Some of the contexts are a mix of messy and clean snippets from the zoning by-law. One context contains a longer and messy snippet of raw text directly extracted from the pdf and another contains a similar long and messy snippet in raw markdown syntax. Snippets of tables in markdown syntax are also included. To challenge the model, sometimes a context is provided that does not contain the answer to the question. In that scenario, the model is required to respond that there is no answer specified."

    "Although DistilBERT outperforms LEGAL-BERT, it appears that it is not ideal for this task.  Fine-tuning DistilBERT or exploring alternative methods, such as OCR (optical character recognition), may yield better results. It seems that manually extracting data from the zoning by-law or using the [Claude LLM API Pipeline](https://github.com/JoT8ng/zoning-extraction-pipelines/blob/main/llm_api_pipeline/src/README.md) would be more effective and efficient despite the problem of hallucinations. Perhaps, NLP models are not the solution for zoning by-laws due to their long, complex and varying formats. OCR (optical character recognition) models could potentially be more suitable for automating this task, although the results would similarly have to be double checked. The limitations of OCRs involve accuracy issues with complex PDF layouts or the need for post-processing the data outputs."
